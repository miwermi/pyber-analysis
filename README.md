# Analysis Overview:
As the a new data analyst at PyBer, a ridesharing app company, my first assignment was to do an exploratory analysis of PyBer's driving data, and specifically to isolate different types of cities (urban, suburban, and rural) and invesitgate differences in number of rides, number of drivers, average fare price, etc. 

This assignment also included showcasing the results by telling a compelling story about the data for each type of city, visualizing the number of drivers and riders, and fare totals and averages, through a variety of charts and graphs.

My final analysis should help stakeholders determine how to improve access and affordability for underserved areas.

## Initial Results:
To target findings to address the main comparison goals, intially data was separated into three new datasets: one for urban areas, one for suburban areas, and one for rural.  This initial separation revealed stark differences immediately and was especially obvious when charted in a scatter plot:

Box and whisker charting and pie options were also visualized:
